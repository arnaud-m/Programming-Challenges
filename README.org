  Arnaud Malapert (course facilitator), Gilles Menez, Valentin Montmirail, Marie Pelleau.
* Introduction

  This course will introduce an interesting variety of subjects in programming, algorithms, and discrete mathematics though puzzles and problems which have appeared in the International ACM Programming Contest and similar venues.

  This is a lecture-lab course in which topics are presented by the instructor, practice problems are explained, and assigned problems are completed by students both during lab periods and outside of class.
